<br>
If you are shot, you will lose a life. If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.
<br>
You can shoot the enemy robots back by firing your weapon. Shooting the enemy robots will destroy them.
<br>
You can also die if you fall in an open pit. This will kill you no matter how many lives you have, so try to avoid falling.
<br>
If you die, you can restart the game from the beginning by pressing the 'r' key.
